<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <code><strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong></code> redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} headers. A browser redirects to this page and search engines update their links to the resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that the 'link-juice' is sent to the new URL). </p>

<p>Even if the specification requires the method (and the body) not to be altered when the redirection is performed, not all user-agents align with it - you can still find this type of bugged software out there. It is therefore recommended to use the <code>301</code> code only as a response for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods and to use the {{HTTPStatus("308", "308 Permanent Redirect")}} for {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with this status.</p>
