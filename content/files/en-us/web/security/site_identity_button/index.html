<p>The <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure">Site Identity Button</a> is a feature in Firefox that gives users more information about the sites they visit.</p>

<p>Depending on the configuration of your website, this button may display a number of different icons.</p>

<p>If the Site Identity Button on your site shows something you do not expect (for example, an orange warning triangle when you expect a green padlock) you can find out the cause of the problem by looking in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Web Console</a> in the Firefox Developer Tools:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Ensure your web console is displaying messages in the 'security' category</li>
 <li>Force-refresh the page on your site that is causing  problems</li>
 <li>Watch for any security messages that may appear</li>
</ol>

<p>A downgraded security UI will  be due to one of these three problems:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Mixed content - while your page has been served over TLS, but subresources loaded for your page have not. In this case, expect to see a 'mixed content' message in the web console.</li>
 <li>Use of a weak cipher - in this case, you're using TLS but a strong cipher was not available. Look for messages about weak ciphers (e.g. RC4).</li>
 <li>Insecure renegotation - older versions of TLS had a flaw in the basic design; if your server uses an affected version, the security UI will be downgraded but no web console message will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
