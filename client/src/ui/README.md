# The UI Folder

The UI folder contains all the UI components of the application.

> NOTE: Some of this is still a work in progress

The most important pieces to understand here is that:

- Small concrete components like a button, goes into the `atoms` folder
- As soon as you combine more that one `atom`, it goes into the `molecules`
  folder
- As soon as you start combining `molecules`, it goes into the `organisms`
  folder

Larger pieces like full pages, will go into the relevant top level folders such
as the `client/src/plus/` folder.

## The `minimalist` folder

This is a not in sync copy of
[mdn-minimalist](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-minimalist). See the note on the
status of this under the `theme` folder docs below.

## The `theme` folder

When we embarked on the redesign, the idea was to use
[mdn-minimalist](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-minimalist) as the base and override
what is different. In the end this proved more cumbersome than we had hoped.
This means that either the `theme` folder will be removed in future or, the
`client/src/ui/minimalist` folder.

For the moment it is a little confusing ðŸ™ƒ - If anything is unclear, please
reach out.

## The `vars` folder

This is the folder into which we will generate the Style Dictionary variables.
You should never need to touch these.
