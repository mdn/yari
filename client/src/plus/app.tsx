              <h4>Web platform features and fallbacks</h4>
              <p>
                If you have discovered that a feature isn’t supported in a
                browser, but still intend to use it, you might need to create a
                fallback for browsers that don't support it. In addition, if you
                are allowing browsers without support to fall back to a basic
                layout, you need to make sure that the code aimed at modern
                browsers doesn’t leak through to older browsers and make a mess.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recent years creating CSS fallbacks has become much easier
                and CSS has native features that can help you. Two of the most
                powerful are the cascade and feature queries, and we'll explore
                these now. Later on we'll also look at how vendor prefixes can
                be a useful tool as long as they are used carefully.
              </p>
              <h4>Using the cascade </h4>
              <p>
                The first thing to look at is how the cascade works with
                properties and values that are not understood by a browser. We
                can create simple fallbacks by writing CSS for old browsers,
                then following it with CSS aimed at newer browsers. For example,
                you might want to provide a simple solid background color for
                really old browsers, and a semi-transparent color for newer
                browsers:
              </p>
              <div className="code-snippet">
                <code>
                  <span className="code-c">background-color</span>: red;
                  <br />
                  <span className="code-c">background-color</span>: rgba(
                  <span className="code-m">255</span>,
                  <span className="code-m">0</span>,
                  <span className="code-m">0</span>,
                  <span className="code-m">0.6</span>);
                </code>
              </div>
            </div>
            {showDeepDive && (
              <div aria-expanded={showDeepDive}>
                <p>
                  The idea is that older browsers support the first declaration
                  and so will apply it to the page, then treat the second one as
                  invalid because they don't support it — this means they
                  completely ignore it. Newer browsers will support both
                  declarations, however the rules of the cascade mean that the
                  declaration that comes later in the stylesheet will override
                  the earlier one, and be used by the browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                  CSS also has rules defining what happens when there are two
                  potentially conflicting things being applied to an element.
                  For example, if you have a floated item and its parent becomes
                  a grid container, the floated item stops behaving like a
                  floated item and becomes a grid item. We can see how this
                  works in the following demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this example, the component has a simple, floated layout.
                  This is the layout that browsers without CSS Grid support will
                  use. For newer browsers the container has been turned into a
                  grid container, which means that in a browser with CSS grid
                  support the float is not applied.
                </p>
                <div className="code-snippet">
                  <div className="codepen">
                    <iframe
                      id="cp_embed_MWJVaqm"
                      src="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/qBrZVVm?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=qBrZVVm&amp;default-tab=css,result"

                      className="codepen"
                      loading="lazy"
                      style={{
                        width: "100%",
                        overflow: "hidden",
                        height: "100%",
                      }}
                      frameBorder={0}
                    ></iframe>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Feature Queries</h4>
                <p>
                  For very simple fallbacks, the overriding method shown
                  previously may work. It can however require that you order the
                  declarations and rules in your CSS carefully, making it more
                  brittle than you might like. You may also run into problems
                  when you want to use additional CSS to enhance the layout in
                  newer browsers, if that CSS is also understood by older
                  browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the next demo, I have given the left-hand column a
                  background color. I only want this to apply to the CSS Grid
                  layout, where I can ensure that the columns will be the same
                  height as each other. However, using the previous method the
                  background color is understood and therefore used by browsers
                  without CSS Grid support too. I have also added widths to the
                  floated elements. As a percentage width is interpreted by the
                  grid layout as a percentage of the column track, this causes
                  the columns to become narrower than the track.
                </p>
                <div className="code-snippet">
                  <div className="codepen">
                    <iframe

                      className="codepen"
                      loading="lazy"
                      style={{
                        width: "100%",
                        overflow: "hidden",
                        height: "100%",
                      }}
                      frameBorder={0}
                    ></iframe>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  In situations like this, CSS Feature Queries are useful. A
                  feature query is similar to a media query, however instead of
                  testing to see how large the viewport is, we are testing to
                  see if a browser has support for that feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Introducing a Feature Query into our demo means that we can
                  wrap up all of our grid code with a test to see if the browser
                  supports <code>display: grid</code>.
                </p>
                <div className="code-snippet">
                  <div className="codepen">
                    <iframe
                      id="cp_embed_MWJVaqm"
                      src="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/xxqVPjq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=MWJVaqm&amp;default-tab=css,result"
                      scrolling="no"
                      allowFullScreen={false}
                      title="Modern CSS 2.3 after"
                      className="codepen"
                      loading="lazy"
                      style={{
                        width: "100%",
                        overflow: "hidden",
                        height: "100%",
                      }}
                      frameBorder={0}
                    ></iframe>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Feature Queries are a simple test to see if the browser can
                  parse a given declaration. They can’t tell you if the browser
                  supports that feature without bugs, however with a good
                  knowledge of browser support they can be a great way to safely
                  add enhancements to a design. In the next article we will look
                  at some more realistic components and how to use this method
                  to build in progressively enhanced support.
                </p>
                <div className="deep-dive-sidebar">
                  <p>
                    You can also test for feature support using JavaScript,
                    using{" "}
                    <a href="(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS/supports">
                      CSS.supports()
                    </a>
                    . As with Feature Queries in CSS, this function takes a
                    property and value as arguments. Therefore, to test for CSS
                    Grid layout support, you would use:
                  </p>
                  <div className="code-snippet">
                    <code>
                      <span className="code-c">let</span>{" "}
                      <span className="code-m">result</span> ={" "}
                      <span className="code-c">CSS</span>.
                      <span className="code-y">supports</span>(“display”,
                      “grid”);
                    </code>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    The returned result is true or false, indicating if the
                    browser does or does not have support.
