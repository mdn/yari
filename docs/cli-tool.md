### test-redirect

Test whether an URL path is a redirect and display the according target.

### add-redirect

Add a redirect to the `_redirects.txt`.

### delete

redirect if deleting a single document. Also stages changes in `git` (except for
redirects).

Move a document and its children. Adds the according redirects and stages
changes in `git` (except for redirects).

environment variable).
