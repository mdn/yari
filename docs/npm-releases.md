# NPM Releases

In essence, every commit to `main` triggers a new build which gets
published on [npmjs.com as
`@mdn/yari`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdn/yari).

## Why we are doing this

The idea is that the content repo needs Yari to start a previewing
server so you can see your changes, on your laptop, as you make them.
But we can't put all of Yari and all the content in the same repo
because of security.

The content is less monitored for security risks and the source code
(i.e. Yari) is highly monitored and contains a lot more power. The
split means we can enable very different continuous integration checks
as the contexts are different. For example, we run unit tests when
dependencies change only on the code.

Another reason for the split is the separation of concerns. This way,
the repository for the source code (again, i.e. Yari) can have issues
and PRs exclusively about the functionality for maintenance and for
development. Whereas the repository for the content can be exclusively
about the content.

## Version numbers

First of all, the version numbers don't matter. We're basically using NPM
releases instead of relying on `git submodule` because tools like
`yarn` is easier to use.

For every commit to `main` our GitHub Action for NPM publishing will
make a patch release. I.e. from `0.9.1` to `0.9.2`. This will happen no
matter how trivial the `main` commit changeset is.

If you want to trigger a release with minor increment (i.e. from `0.9.2`
to `0.10.0`) you make a commit with a message that contains the
prefix `feature: ...` or `feat: ...`.

If you want to trigger a release with a major increment (i.e. from
`0.9.2` to `1.0.0`) you make a commit with a message that contains the
string `BREAKING CHANGE`.

## Food for future thought

We might want to consider something like
[`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
will instead create a PR about making a new version. That would slow
down the NPM releases but maybe that's better if too many commit messages
cause too many releases.
