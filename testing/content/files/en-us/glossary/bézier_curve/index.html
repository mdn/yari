<p>A <strong>Bézier curve</strong> (pronounced [bezje]) is a mathematically described curve used in computer graphics and animation. In {{Glossary("vector image", "vector images")}}, they are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.</p>

<p>What's so special about this page is that it's got a non-ascii character in the directory name and the slug.</p>
