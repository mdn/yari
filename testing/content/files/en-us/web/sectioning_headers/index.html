title: Sectioning headers
slug: Web/Sectioning_headers

<p>
  This page has <code>h2</code> and <code>h3</code> tags that do NOT site at the root.
  That's a flaw, and this page exists to prove that it gets caught as a <code>sectioning</code>
  flaw when built.
</p>

<div>
  <h2 id="first">First</h2>

  <p>
    The builder is able to cope OK if the <code>h2</code> is the only
    one at this level. But the problem is going to be this next one...
  </p>
  <h2 id="second">Second</h2>

  <p>
    Note that the ^ above-mentioned <code>h2</code> isn't treated
    as a heading that appears in the TOC. Only the first one is.
  </p>
</div>
