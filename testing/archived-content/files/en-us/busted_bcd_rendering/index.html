<div class="bc-data">

    There was a time when the <i>old</i> <code>Compat</code> macro didn't inject
    the "BCD query" as an <code>id</code> attribute on the
    <code>&lt;div class=&quot;bc-data&quot;&gt;</code> tag.<br />
    This would cause problems in Yari when it tried to break up the page into
    sections.

    The whole point of this sample fixture data is to verify the fix for
