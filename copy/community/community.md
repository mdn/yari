## MDN's community powers the web

MDN’s strength comes from the passion and dedication of our global community.
Since our founding in 2005, we’ve grown into a thriving network. Together, we’ve
created a comprehensive, open, and free resource that serves web developers
across the globe. With volunteers leading translation efforts in
[7 languages](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Translated_content), we’re
truly international.

## Meet our contributors

We are an open-source community dedicated to building resources for a better
web. Our diverse contributors, including developers, technical writers,
students, educators, designers, and more, come from various backgrounds and
platforms. Anyone can contribute, and each contribution strengthens our
community, driving innovation and improving this vital resource for developers
worldwide.
