# Frequently asked questions

## Should I implement all recommendations?

Yes, you should do it if possible. There is no way to programmatically determine
the risk level of any given site. However, while your site may not be high-risk,
it is still worth learning about the defensive security standards highlighted by
Observatory, and implementing them wherever you can.

## If I get an A+ grade, does that mean my site is secure?

We'd love to say that any site that gets an A+ Observatory grade is perfectly
secure, but there are a lot of security considerations that we can't test.
Observatory tests for preventative measures against
[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks,
[manipulator-in-the-middle (MiTM)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MitM) attacks,
cross-domain information leakage, insecure
[cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies),
[Content Delivery Network](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) (CDN) compromises, and
improperly issued certificates.

However, it does not test for outdated software versions,
[SQL injection](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SQL_Injection) vulnerabilities, vulnerable
content management system plugins, improper creation or storage of passwords,
and more. These are just as important as the issues Observatory _does_ test for,
and site operators should not be neglectful of them simply because they score
well on Observatory.

## Can I scan non-websites, such as API endpoints?

The HTTP Observatory is designed for scanning websites, not API endpoints. It
can be used for API endpoints, and the security headers expected by Observatory
shouldn't cause any negative impact for APIs that return exclusively data, such
as JSON or XML. However, the results may not accurately reflect the security
posture of the API. API endpoints generally should only be accessible over
HTTPS. The recommended configuration for API endpoints is:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

## Can other people see my test results?

Anyone can choose to scan any domain, and the scan history for each domain is
public. However, HTTP Observatory does not store user data related to each scan.
In the old version of HTTP Observatory, users could choose to set their scan to
"public" or keep it private (the default), and there was a "recent scans" list
where domain names were listed. "Recent scans" was the main feature that users
would potentially wish to opt-out from, but it is no longer supported, hence
there is now no reason to provide the "public" flag.

## When did the move occur?

The new HTTP Observatory was launched on MDN on July 2, 2024. The old Mozilla
Observatory — containing HTTP Observatory plus other tools like TLS Observatory,
SSH Observatory, and Third-party tests — has been sunset in October 2024.

> **Note:** Historic scan data has been preserved, and is included in the
> provided scan history for each domain.

## What has changed after the migration?

The MDN team has:

- Updated the user experience to improve the site's look and make it easier to
  use. For example, the recommendations highlighted by the test results are all
  shown together, instead of one at a time.
- Updated the
  [accompanying documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides#content_security_fundamentals)
  to bring it up to date and improve legibility.
- Changed the "rescan" checkbox and its underlying mechanics:
  - There is no longer a rescan parameter.
  - A site can only be scanned and a new result returned every 60 seconds.
  - Deep-linking into a report initiates a rescan if the previous scan data is
    older than 24 hours.
- Updated the
  [tests](/en-US/observatory/docs/tests_and_scoring#tests-and-score-modifiers)
  to bring them up-to-date with latest security best practices:
  - Removed the out-of-date `X-XSS-Protection` test.
  - Removed the out-of-date Flash and Silverlight (`clientaccesspolicy.xml` and
    `crossdomain.xml`) embedding tests.
  - Added a
    [`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy)
    (CORP) test.
  - Updated the
    [`Referrer-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) test to
    update the score modifier for `referrer-policy-unsafe` and remove the
    `referrer-policy-no-referrer-when-downgrade` result.

## Has the HTTP Observatory API been updated to use the new tests?

Yes. The new v2 API is available at an updated URL —
`https://observatory-api.mdn.mozilla.net/api/v2/scan` — and the response is now
more concise. For example, a [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) request
to `https://observatory-api.mdn.mozilla.net/api/v2/scan?host=mdn.net` will
return a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "id": 53494870,
  "details_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/analyze?host=mdn.dev",
  "algorithm_version": 4,
  "scanned_at": "2024-10-11T13:21:36.453Z",
  "error": null,
  "grade": "A+",
  "score": 105,
  "status_code": 200,
  "tests_failed": 0,
  "tests_passed": 10,
  "tests_quantity": 10
}
```

We have removed several fields that were of limited use for CI integration, like
the complete response header listing. The important metrics like `score` and
`grade` are still included. We encourage you to migrate to the new API as soon
as possible: The v1 endpoint will be shut down on October 31, 2024.

For reference, the v1 API returned a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "algorithm_version": 3,
  "end_time": "Fri, 11 Oct 2024 13:19:31 GMT",
  "grade": "A+",
  "hidden": false,
  "likelihood_indicator": "LOW",
  "response_headers": {
    "Accept-Ranges": "none",
    "Another-Header": "another-value"
  },
  "scan_id": 56728847,
  "score": 100,
  "start_time": "Fri, 11 Oct 2024 13:19:30 GMT",
  "state": "FINISHED",
  "status_code": 200,
  "tests_failed": 0,
  "tests_passed": 10,
  "tests_quantity": 10
}
```

## Does the new HTTP Observatory provide specific TLS and certificate data?

The previous Observatory site included specific results tabs containing TLS and
certificate analysis data. The new one does not, and there are currently no
plans to include these features: it provides a clear focus on HTTP data.

## (Redirection) What is the HTTP redirection test assessing?

This test is checking whether your web server is making its
[initial redirection from HTTP to HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#http_redirection),
on the same hostname, before doing any further redirections. This allows the
HTTP
[`Strict-Transport-Security`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
(HSTS) header to be applied properly.

For example, this redirection order is correct:

`http://example.com` → `https://example.com` → `https://www.example.com`

An incorrect (and penalized) redirection looks like this:

`http://example.com` → `https://www.example.com`

## (X-Frame-Options) What if I want to allow my site to be framed?

As long as you are explicit about your preference by using the
[`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
[`frame-ancestors`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)
directive, you will pass the
[`X-Frame-Options`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) test. For
example, to allow your site to be framed by any HTTPS site:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https:
```
