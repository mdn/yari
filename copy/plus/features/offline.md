Some insight into what can be expected from using MDN Offline

### Browsing Content

If offline mode is enabled, offline content is preferred. All content works
without an internet connection, with the exception of a few github-based
examples and large video files. You can also indicate you prefer offline content
even when online.

> NOTE: MDN Offline cannot be used while in a private or incognito window.

### Collections

Previously saved pages will appear as such, and you will be able to browse your
**Collections**. However, editing a saved page (adding/removing) does not work
without an active internet connection.

### Notifications

Previously received notifications will be displayed and can be read. However,
notifications read while in offline mode will not be marked as read for later,
and cannot be starred or deleted without an active internet connection.
