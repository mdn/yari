## What is the Playground?

The Playground is the new web development tool provided by MDN. It serves as a
platform for web developers to preview and experiment with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript code. The Playground offers features like basic autocomplete, code
formatting using the popular "prettier" tool, and the ability to share your work
with others. By integrating the Playground into our web docs, MDN aims to
provide an enhanced learning and coding experience for developers.

## Key Features

The MDN Playground comes packed with several key features, including:

**Preview:** Instantly see the results of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

**Autocomplete:** Benefit from basic code suggestions and auto-completion to
speed up your coding process.

**Code Formatting:** Utilize the powerful "prettier" tool to automatically
format your code for better readability.

**Sharing:** Share your amazing work with others by publishing your code and
sharing the generated link.

**Integration within MDN:** Seamlessly access the Playground within MDN,
enabling a comprehensive learning experience.
