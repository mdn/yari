# AI Help

The AI Help feature is an interactive interface developed by MDN in
collaboration with Supabase and OpenAI. It uses GPT-3.5 to provide interactive
and timely guidance on coding tasks, programming concepts and assistance
debugging errors. Whether a beginner or an experienced developer, AI Help
enhances your learning experience and improves productivity using comprehensive
MDN references, guides, and resources that document the web for its contextual
help.

## Using AI Help feature

You can navigate to [AI Help](/en-US/plus/ai-help) from the menu bar at the top
of MDN pages. Type a question about web development in the text input field,
press Enter, or click the "send" button. The AI Help service processes your
query and generates a response with an explanation, code examples where
appropriate, and links to resources on MDN to find out more.

In addition to asking questions, you can also use AI Help to do the following:

1. **Natural language search**: AI Help searches the MDN documentation for you
   and helps you quickly find what you are looking for without you having to
   browse through all MDN’s pages. It also summarizes the information in a
   concise and easy to read way.

2. **Find code examples**: AI Help offers practical coding examples to assist
   developers in understanding and implementing various programming concepts,
   syntax, APIs, and frameworks. When asking questions or seeking guidance on a
   particular topic, AI Help provides code snippets illustrating how to use the
   queried feature with modern language idioms in your applications.

3. **Related MDN pages**: AI Help creates responses with links to relevant MDN
   documentation pages where possible. The MDN resources it suggests allow you
   to explore the topics you're interested in, including examples and references
   written by subject matter experts.
