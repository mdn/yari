# AI Help

> Get real-time assistance and support

AI Help, available for both free and paid MDN Plus subscribers, utilizes OpenAI
GPT-4o mini for free users and GPT-4o for paying subscribers to enhance the MDN
experience. It offers quick and effective access to MDN's broad database. It
specializes in searching and summarizing MDN content to directly address your
queries. Additionally, for web development queries not covered in MDN, AI Help
draws on its external knowledge, always indicating when the sources are from
outside MDN.

## Key Features

- **Asking Questions**: You can ask your web development related questions
  directly on MDN, in AI Help.
- **Content Search**: AI Help locates relevant articles from MDN's pages and
  presents them to you.
- **Summary Generation**: It offers concise summaries as answers to your
  questions, providing the option to explore the sources directly, read the
  summary, or both.
- **Code Testing**: When articles include code examples, you can test the code
  directly in the [MDN Playground](/en-US/play), allowing you to immediately
  check the code accuracy.
