When you watch a page, MDN Plus sends you notifications for significant events
relating to that page. For example, you’ll receive a notification when there’s a
major update to the content of the page.

If a page has a browser compatibility table, then you can subscribe to
notifications for web platform feature events such as:

- New and upcoming browser support
- Removed browser support
- New subfeatures
- Fixes to missing support data

## Getting started

To start getting notifications, **watch** your first page. To do this, visit a
page, then click **Watch → Watch page**.

When there are notifications, an indicator appears in the user menu on any MDN
page or in the notifications list.

## About your notifications inbox

review all of your read, unread, and starred notifications from the
notifications list. Only the most-recent 5,000 notifications are kept in your
inbox. Older notifications may be deleted.
