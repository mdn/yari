> From tutorial pages to API references, get notifications for the latest developments on MDN.

When you watch a page, MDN Plus sends you notifications for significant events relating to that page. For example, you’ll receive a notification when there’s a major update to the content of the page.

If a page has a browser compatibility table, then you can subscribe to notifications for web platform feature events such as:

- New and upcoming browser support
- Removed browser support
- New subfeatures
- Fixes to missing support data

## Getting started

To start getting notifications, **watch** your first page. To do this, visit a page, then click **Watch → Watch page**.
When there are notifications, an indicator appears in the user menu on any MDN page or in the notifications list.

## See what pages you’re watching

You can see what pages you’re watching in two ways:

1. Click on **MDN Plus → Notifications → Watch list**
2. Click on your profile photo in the right corner of your screen and select **Notifications** from the drop-down list.

## Star a notification and review it

If you want to save a notification for later, go to the **Notifications page** and click the **Star** icon next to the notification you want to save.
To see a list of starred notifications, go to the **Notifications** page and click **Starred**.

## Stop watching a page

You can **stop watching a page** in two ways:

1. Visit the page you want to stop watching, then click **Watching → Unwatch**.
2. Go to **Notifications → Watch list**, and use the **⋮ menu** to the right of the watched page and select **Unwatch**.
   Your watched page has now been removed. Select Undo in the notification at the bottom of the screen to revert this action.

You can also **Bulk unwatch** by checking the box on top of your **Watched list** and then clicking **Unwatch**

## About your notifications inbox

The user menu on MDN pages shows a dot when you have notifications. You can review all of your read, unread, and starred notifications from the notifications list.
Only the most-recent 5,000 notifications are kept in your inbox. Older notifications may be deleted.
