# Notifications

> No more surprises: _watch specific pages_ for changes that impact your projects
>
> From tutorial pages to API references, get notifications for the latest developments on MDN.

When you watch a page, MDN Plus sends you notifications for significant events relating to that page. For example, you’ll receive a notification when there’s a major update to the content of the page.

If a page has a browser compatibility table, then you can subscribe to notifications for web platform feature events such as:

- New and upcoming browser support
- Removed browser support
- New subfeatures
- Fixes to missing support data

## Getting started

To start getting notifications, **watch** your first page. To do this, visit a page, then click **Watch → Watch page**.

When there are notifications, an indicator appears in the user menu on any MDN page or in the notifications list.

You can see what pages you’re watching in two ways:
