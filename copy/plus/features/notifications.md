> From tutorial pages to API references, get notifications for the latest developments on MDN.

When you watch a page, MDN Plus sends you notifications for significant events relating to that page. For example, you’ll receive a notification when there’s a major update to the content of the page.

If a page has a browser compatibility table, then you can subscribe to notifications for web platform feature events such as:

- New and upcoming browser support
- Removed browser support
- New subfeatures
- Fixes to missing support data
