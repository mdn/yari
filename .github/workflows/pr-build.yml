          # pages in a PR build if the diff doesn't have any index.html
          # files changed.
          # Instead of building the git diff, you build some known typical
          # folders that you know don't take too long and do cover a lot
          # of interesting macros etc.
          # This way, when an edit to the source code comes in, perhaps the
          # functional tests have a gap in them but actually building
          # real content exposes it.
