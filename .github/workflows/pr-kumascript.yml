# This workflow exclusively and specifically only checks the
# kumascript test suite.
# But if a package gets upgraded (e.g. Dependabot making a PR)
# that should test the kumascript suite too because the packages
# might have (and we've seen it happen!) an impact on the suite.

# Note that lint checking and stuff for files with `kumascript/**`
# is done with the general testing workflow.
