"""
A great way to debug analyzers is with the `Document._index.analyze()` API which
is a convenient abstraction for the Elasticsearch Analyze API
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-analyze.html

But you can also use the Deployer CLI tool. For example:

    poetry run deployer search-analyze "l'avion" html_text_analyzer

An important thing to note is that if you change the analyzers (here in the Python
code) it won't take effect until you rebuild the index. So you might need to run

    # before
    poetry run deployer search-analyze "l'avion" html_text_analyzer
    poetry run deployer search-index ../client/build
    # after
    poetry run deployer search-analyze "l'avion" html_text_analyzer
